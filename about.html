								<h3>Space Exploration and Development</h3>
                                <p>Established in the Spring of 2020, Eagle SEDS aims to bring together students of all majors at
								Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University – Prescott under one common interest – space. Creating an organization
								for students who love space will lead to greater connections and future opportunities. SEDS in its
								entirety is “an organization to promote space exploration and development through education and engineering
								projects.” Such projects include NASA rover competitions, assisting Eagle SAT with their projects, and
								providing support for other engineering clubs on campus. <br />SEDS USA aims to foster the future leaders
								and contributors in the space industry. SpaceVision is the title conference that is hosted once a year to
								bring together all SEDS chapters to hear speakers (like Poppy Northcutt), participate in contests
								(like the business pitch competition), and attend workshops and panels
								(like Off-The-Record, an inside look on industry).</p>

								<h3>Outreach and Networking</h3>
                                <p>Outreach and networking is an important aspect of Eagle-SEDS. Working with the younger generations
								to inspire a career in STEM (mainly space) is going to be a top priority. Hosting workshops, social
								events, and tutoring programs for the local community is a goal for our organization. A main event
								we intend on holding is called Yuri’s Night - an international celebration that celebrates the first man in space,
								Yuri Gagarin. This event would be open to the campus community and, in the future, be open to
								the general public.<br /></p>
                                <p>Through SpaceVision, members have the opportunity to connect with top industry professionals both at
								the career fair and also during mingling and social events during the conferences. Conference attendees could potentially cross paths with
								the CFO of NASA, the Chief of Staff of NASA, the President of Virgin Galactic, and more. Companies
								like Lockheed Martin, Virgin Orbit, Virgin Galactic, and Sierra Nevada attend the career fair to meet 
								students - future potentials for their job openings. In the past, students have received job offers as a direct result of attending
								this conference and making these connections.</p>
