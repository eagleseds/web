                    <p>
                        <i>Majoring in Space Physics</i><br />
                        Ashley joined SEDS and helped establish Embry-Riddle Prescott's
                        chapter because she absolutely loves space, and would love
                        to bring together anyone and everyone to further our search into space.
                        After graduation she plans to go to graduate school for Astrophysics
                        with a focus in exoplanet research.

                        Connor attended SpaceVision 2019, saw the many opportunities available through SEDS,
                        and was inspired to join. The fact that this organization is open to all majors,
                        and encourages them to work together, allows him to explore ideas beyond his own major.
                        He wanted to help start a club that would broaden horizons for all students. At this
                        time, he has no set plans for after graduation, but is exploring PhD programs
                        and continuing the research he started while at ERAU.

                        Caitlyn joined SEDS because after going to her first SpaceVision conference, she fell
                        in love with the community and wanted to make meaningful contributions by helping create
                        her own school's chapter. She believes being the EagleSEDS Secretary will be a good start
                        to getting more involved and allow her to connect and share her passion with others who
                        have the same interests, as well as build good leadership skills. Caitlyn is also the
                        Vice President of SPS at ERAU Prescott and is part of an Electric Propulsion research
                        team on campus. After graduation, she would like to pursue a job in industry while
                        potentially furthering her education.

                        She also joined because she wanted to experience uniting with other majors over
                        one cause. She believes as treasurer, there will be a large push to raise funding
                        so club members can focus more on their projects/tasks. Teagan is also a member of
                        Society of Physics Students with hopes of joining a research team. After graduation,
                        she aspires to do research in theoretical physics wherever the skies are clearest.
